# How to Run Dev and Test Environment

## Dependencies
- List all dependencies here
- Don't forget to include versions
### Downloading Dependencies
Describe where to download the dependencies here. Some will likely require a web download. Provide links here. For IDE extensions, make sure your project works with the free version of them, and detail which IDE(s) these are available in. 

## Commands
Describe how the commands and process to launch the project on the main branch in such a way that anyone working on the project knows how to check the affects of any code they add.

```sh

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
After run dev clear cache if error with: Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
